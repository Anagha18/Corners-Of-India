		<p class="explain" style="font-size:24px;font-family:comic sans ms">Famously known as Devbhumi, or the Land of the Gods, Uttarakhand is a land of untouched natural beauty and sublime spirituality. Carved out from Uttar Pradesh, the state, formerly known as Uttaranchal, is a place that not only boasts of a scintillating view of the Himalayas but also exhibits a cultural ethos which speaks of a simplistic and harmonic coexistence with nature. With oaks, birches, silver firs and rhododendrons adorning the steep mountain slopes, Uttarakhand offers you a glimpse into an untainted, idyllic world, straight out of the pages of some ancient pastoral literature.

Uttarakhand is a very popular pilgrimage site, seeing as it is the originating spot of the Ganga and the Yamuna, two of the most sacred rivers for Hindus. Uttarakhand is home to the Char Dhams, which are four of the most pious sites of pilgrimage revered by the Hindus â€“ Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath. Thousands of tourists visit Uttarakhand annually to pay homage to the Char Dhams.

Ancient temples, forest reserves, national parks, hill stations, and mountain peaks welcome you in the calm, cooling air of Uttarakhand and the joy doubly increases as we reveal that you can visit some of the famous hill stations of India in Uttarakhand. Mussoorie, Nainital, Dhanaulti, Lansdowne, Sattal, Almora, Kausani, Bhimtal, and Ranikhet are ever embracing hill stations in the state best for all kinds of trips be it a family holiday or a honeymoon.</p>

		<div class="name" id="two">Haridwar... </div>
		<hr/>
		<div class="pdheader">
		<p class="explain">No spiritual journey can ever be considered complete without a visit to Haridwar, one of the holiest pilgrimage sites for Hindus. Literally meaning 'the abode of Lord Vishnu', Haridwar, located in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, is a land of legends and myths. Considered as one of the seven holiest cities in India, Haridwar sees millions of people flock to it every year to pay their respects to the Lord, or to wash away their sins. However, with the passage of time, Haridwar has evolved from being a mere religious city to a multifaceted cultural and spiritual centre, and only after exploring Haridwar will you realize that there is a lot more to the city than just visiting temples and taking a dip in the holy Har ki Pauri. Haridwar has a perennial mystical air around i, and is the perfect holiday option for anyone seeking spiritual connection as well as a chance to indulge in and get closer to nature.

Har Ki Pauri is, of course, the most visited place in Haridwar. Har ki Pauri is essentially a ghat built by King Vikramaditya in the memory of his brother, and the location is thronged by devotees all year round. Every evening, as the sun goes down, the Ganga aarti is performed at the ghat, turning the place into a glittering, sensory spectacle. With flaming torches and ringing bells wherever you look, the evening aarti at Har ki Pauri is a mesmerising event that should in no way be missed out on. Other ghats in Haridwar that you can visit are the Gau ghat and the Vishnu Ghat.</p>

		<div class="name" id="four">Kedarnath... </div>
		<hr/>
		<div class="pdheader">
		<p class="explain">Atop 3584 mts, this is one of the Char Dhams and one of the busiest pilgrim centres in the Garhwal Himalayas. It is believed that in order to evade the Pandavas, Lord Shiva hid himself in the form of a bull at Kedarnath, and when found by the Pandavas, he went further into the earth leaving the hump on the surface.

Kedarnath is popular for its ancient Shiva Temple, shrines, Himalayan ranges and undulating landscapes. Marked by the Kedarnath temple, near Chorabari Glacier, the area is flanked by the Kedarnath peaks and countless more ranges with peaks silver with snow. The most remote of the Char Dhams, and maybe hence, one of the most majestically beautiful, Kedarnath remains closed for the six months of winters due to unbearable temperatures and heavy snowfall</p>

The two distinct regions, Kumaon and Garhwal offer palates of flavoursome dishes that are high on nutrition as well.

<div class="pdheader">
		<p class="explain">Uttarakhand has a cultured and colourful society. Uttarakhand has every thing that any tourist could want.
